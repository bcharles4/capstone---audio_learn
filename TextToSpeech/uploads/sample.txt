Yeah, you could be the greatest, you can be the best
You can be the King Kong bangin' on your chest
You could beat the world, you could beat the war
You could talk to God, go bangin' on his door
You can throw your hands up, you can beat the clock (yeah)
You can move a mountain, you can break rocks
You could be a master, don't wait for luck

Dedicate yourself and you gon' find yourself
Standing in the hall of fame (yeah)
And the world's gonna know your name (yeah)
'Cause you burn with the brightest flame (yeah)
And the world's gonna know your name (yeah)
And you'll be on the walls of the hall of fame
